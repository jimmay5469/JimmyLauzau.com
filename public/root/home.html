<h1>Hi, my name is Jimmy Lauzau!</h1>
<p>I am a software developer with a Computer Science Engineering degree from Ohio State University.  I graduated in 2008, but have been playing with code ever since I was young.  I view code as a brain teaser puzzle and find it very rewarding to figure something out.  Learning new ways of doing things keeps me very excited and interested in programming.</p>
<p>Besides writing code, one of my biggest passions is cycling.  I love mountain biking, road biking, bike maintenance, and generally anything with wheels.  I also have many other hobbies including photography, anything outdoors, and any do-it-yourself projects.</p>
